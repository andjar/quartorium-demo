# Introduction

This document is a simple demonstration of a Quarto manuscript.
We will show how to include text, citations, a plot, a table, and a mathematical formula.
All of these elements can be cross-referenced.

For example, this is a citation to a classic work by Knuth [-@knuth1984].
You can also cite in parentheses like this: (@knuth1984).

# Analysis

In this section, we conduct a simple analysis.

## Making a Plot

We can easily create plots using a code chunk.
@fig-cars shows a simple scatter plot of car stopping distances versus speed.
We refer to this plot using its label, like this: see @fig-cars.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cars
#| fig-cap: "A scatter plot of the 'cars' dataset, showing stopping distance as a function of speed."
#| warning: false

# This is an R code chunk that generates a plot.
# Quarto can also use Python, Julia, and Observable JS.
plot(1)
```

## Making a Table

Tables can be created using Markdown syntax.
@tbl-summary provides a summary of our hypothetical findings.
As shown in @tbl-summary, the results are very promising.

| Treatment | Group A | Group B |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Control   | 25.4    | 28.1    |
| Active    | 15.2    | 17.5    |

: A summary of hypothetical results. {#tbl-summary}

## Using Formulas

We can also include mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax.
A block equation can be labeled and referenced.
For instance, the quadratic formula is shown in @eq-quadratic.

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$ {#eq-quadratic}

This is a fundamental equation in algebra.

# Conclusion

We have successfully demonstrated the core features of a Quarto manuscript, including plots (@fig-cars), tables (@tbl-summary), and equations (@eq-quadratic).
